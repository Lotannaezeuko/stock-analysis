- **Sector**: The industry the company operates in (e.g., Technology, Healthcare).
- **P/E Ratio** *(Price to Earnings)*: How much investors pay for each $1 of profit. Lower can mean undervalued.
- **Dividend Yield**: The percentage of the stock price paid back to investors as dividends.
- **Market Capitalization**: The total value of all a company‚Äôs shares. Large cap = more stable.
- **EPS (Earnings Per Share)**: Company profit divided by the number of shares. Higher = more profitable.
- **Price-to-Book Ratio**: Compares the stock price to the company‚Äôs net worth. Under 1 can suggest undervaluation.
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Shows how much debt a company has vs. shareholder equity. Lower = less financial risk.
